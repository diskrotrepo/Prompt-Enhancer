# Prompt Enhancer

Prompt Enhancer is a small web tool for building AI prompts. It combines base prompts with positive and negative modifiers to produce two variations. Everything runs in the browser with no build step.

Open `src/index.html` to use the tool. Enter a list of base phrases, pick modifier presets and press **Generate**. You can save your data to a file or reload it later.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests live in the `tests/` directory and cover all functionality.
