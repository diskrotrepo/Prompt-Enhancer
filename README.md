# Prompt-Enhancer
A prompt enhancer that includes various modes with sticky negative support.

The project is now purely JavaScript-based with a single web interface.

## Web Interface
Open `index.html` in your browser to use the tool. It provides text areas for a base prompt list, a "bad" descriptor list, and a list of negative modifiers. You can choose default, empty, or custom lists using the drop-down menus next to each box. The page has a dark style loosely inspired by Diskrot.
