# AGENT Instructions for Prompt-Enhancer

This project is a lightweight web tool written in vanilla JavaScript. Indentation is two spaces with no trailing whitespace.
All client logic lives in a single `script.js` file to make code search easy when collaborating with an LLM. Keep that file well commented and organized as described in `src/AGENTS.md`.

The project embraces the **50% Rule**: many small, better-than-even improvements compound into reliable software. Document intent and reasoning so later revisions build on that advantage.

For development details see `src/AGENTS.md`.

## Testing

Run all programmatic checks with:

```bash
npm test
```

Always execute the test suite whenever you change code.
